/************************* Explanation***************************
these two lines saved us too much code:
z01.PrintRune(rune(hex[arr[i]>>4]))
z01.PrintRune(rune(hex[arr[i]&15]))

so let's try to understand them:

The conversion from binary to hexadecimal is efficient
and straightforward because both are base-2 systems,
meaning hexadecimal is a base-16 system which is a power
of 2 (2^4 = 16). This relationship allows for a direct
and simple conversion process, unlike the conversion
between binary and decimal, where the base-10 system does
not align as neatly with binary's base-2 system.

Each hexadecimal digit can represent four binary digits
(bits) because 2^4 = 16. Thus, one hexadecimal digit can
exactly represent a range from 0000 to 1111 in binary
(or 0 to 15 in decimal).

Since one hexadecimal digit corresponds to exactly 4 bits
in binary, we can split a byte (8 bits) into two halves,
with each half directly mapping to a single hexadecimal
digit. This is why the method involves isolating the
high and low 4-bit parts of the byte.

High-order Half (arr[i]>>4):
By shifting the byte to the right by 4 bits (>>4), you
effectively discard the lower 4 bits and move the upper
4 bits to the position of the lower 4 bits. This
operation transforms the upper half of the byte into
a value that can be directly looked up in a hexadecimal
mapping. For any given byte, this reveals the hexadecimal
digit for the more significant part (the "high-order" half).

Low-order Half (arr[i]&15):
Applying a bitwise AND operation with 15 (0x0F or
00001111 in binary) masks the upper 4 bits of the
byte, isolating the lower 4 bits. This is because
any bit ANDed with 0 results in 0, and any bit
ANDed with 1 remains unchanged. This operation
reveals the hexadecimal digit for the less significant
part (the "low-order" half).
